# antz

A small game inspired by `AntMe!` where you control an ant colony through scripting in order to get more points.

The game is written in Rust and uses `ggez` as game engine.

# WIP

Currently the project is work in progress and not in a usable state.

Things that already work:
- rendering
- ant spawns
- apple spawns
- sugar spawns
- basic movement (currently random, because scripting is missing)

Things that don't work, but will work in the future:
- scripting
- scoring
- more functions to control ants
- stable API
- simulate multiple ant colonies at once
- UI (maybe)
